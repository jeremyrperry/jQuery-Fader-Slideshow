You are free to utilize this slideshow in any manner on any number of websites that you own for non-commercial purposes (i.e. you are not using my code as a way of directly generating money, or using it to power paid content).  You are also free to modify the source code as you see fit, including but not limited to changing the timing, adjusting the HTML and CSS, etc.  If any part of my original code is used, you must keep notation in your code of me as either the author or that your work was based upon my original design.  Any web-based redistribution of my original code is prohibited.  Any commercial distribution of work based on my original code requires my pre-approval, including sites with paid content that utilize my code in whole or in part.

This code can be used for sliding through images, text, and more.  Implementation and modification of this code will require a person knowledgeable with HTML, CSS and jQuery/JavaScript.  It utilizes all client-side methods so it will work on just about any server platform.  The code was developed with jQuery 1.7.2, and the same version is recommended to ensure there are no bugs.  It may be necessary to change the "$" to "jQuery" in the JavaScript code to make the code work properly, depending on your jQuery setup.  I will not provide any technical support.  Bug reports are welcome.

The fade-in, fade-out, and delay times must be equal amounts to prevent any jerking mothion.  The overall time for the slide should account for the fading motions, or display irregularities may result.
